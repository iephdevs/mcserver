This project is to make installation of Minecraft server easier on any ubuntu/debian running machine. It is heavely focused to host this minecraft server to the cloud.
To make the script i have taken Inspiration from lot of people For Example [BugsWriter](https://github.com/Bugswriter) & None Other than [LukeSmith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz).

The [Older](https://github.com/lordofwizard/minecraft_server) version is still running but not recommended to install because of some issues with disconnecting and installation of modded minecraft servers.
